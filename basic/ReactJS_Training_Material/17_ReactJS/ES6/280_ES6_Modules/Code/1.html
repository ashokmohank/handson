  <!--
    import/export is not yet supported in chrome browser. So a polyfill named browser-es-module-loader has been used to make import/export work.

    This polyfill was first installed with below command:
    npm install browser-es-module-loader --save

    Polyfill details: https://github.com/ModuleLoader/browser-es-module-loader

    After installation, babel-browser-build.js and browser-es-module-loader.js files were copied from folder: .node_modules/browser-es-module-loader/dist

    These files were referenced from this html file using script tag.

    The example module app1.js was referenced through another script tag but with type set to "module".
  -->

  <script type="module" src="js/app1.js"></script>

  <!--
    As the script type is "module", chrome does not allow accessing local files. So all the files have to be served over a web server. 
    For this, a node.js express server has been used.

    Just run the below command to server the files over a local web server:
    node nodeapp.js
